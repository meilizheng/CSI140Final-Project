                <h2>Back Yard Chicken</h2>
                <p>Many families choose to keep birds in their backyards. Backyard birds, or poultry, are increasing in number in urban and suburban areas. People keep backyard poultry for many reasons, including to produce food (fresh eggs or meat), companionship, hobby, exhibition, and education. Backyard poultry most commonly includes domesticated chickens, ducks, geese, guinea fowl, and turkeys. If you own poultry, knowing key prevention practices to ensure health for you, your family, and your flock is important.</p>
                <p>With egg prices rising and concerns over food security increasing, some folks have taken a step toward self-sufficiency and opted to raise chickens in their backyards. Whether for meat or solely for eggs, having your own coop may be a great solution if you’ve been struggling to find ingredients for your breakfast omelet.</p>
                <p>Raising chickens can be many things: therapeutic, rewarding, fun and for beginners maybe a bit nerve wracking! There is literally tons of information about raising chicks and chickens and it is hard to sort through it all to determine what is right, what is not and what is just plain weird.</p>

                <h3>benefits of a backyard flock </h3>
                <p>One of the most prominent benefits of a backyard flock is that you can produce your own food. Poultry breeds are divided primarily into three groups: egg layers, meat producers and show birds.</p>

                <h3>Differend Breeds Of Chicken</h3>
                <p>Once you have secured permission from your local community and governing bodies, you are in a good position to consider which of the many chicken breeds you would like to raise. There are nearly as many breeds of chickens as there are flavors of ice cream, and like ice cream, you have options ranging from artisanal to conventional flavors. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Make a Difference</h3>
                <p>When chickens are properly cared for and fed a good diet, each hen can produce up to 300 fresh eggs per year. When chickens are molting and when winter results in shorter hours of daylight, egg laying rates generally decline, but it doesn’t get more local than your own back yard. Eggs are a cheap, nutritious source of protein.</p>

                    <p>Description: Plymouth Rock is one of Americas’ oldest breeds. The hen was seen from coast to coast before the end of World War 2, and it became the nation’s main source of chicken meat and eggs.
                        As a dual purpose hen, it excelled in good quality meat production and good egg production, the only hen that could rival it was the Rhode Island Red.
